A couple examples of projects completed at university utilising R, to manipulate and visualise data for analysis.
#
Statistical Models B Project used the sugar.txt data set to form a linear model. The model utilises regression to simplify the model base off given statistical analysis.
#

Later on, the code moves onto trials of loops, determining the probability of ruin and the respective confidence interval of this
